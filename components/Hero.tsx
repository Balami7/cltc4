              The Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre is a Parastatal in the Federal Ministry of Youths.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is principally a human resource development outfit established for the training and moulding of Nigeria Citizenry to become responsible and respectable Citizens and Leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Centre is by all indications the only informal educational institution in Nigeria that executes experiential and Outward Bound education. It provides citizenship and leadership training in an atmosphere in which self-discovery and self-actualization are evidently based on one’s competence and ability, irrespective of origin, belief or class.
